## WebRobotDrawer

a stub for a two wheels robot that would receive a svg path from a web interface, to trace it with a pen passing through its center.

Got it to the stage that it would badly draw nonsense https://youtu.be/cnQzR97IalA

It currently features a svg string to low level op converter and interpreter.

The plan was to add a bezier path to circle segment converter, and after that a web interface to receive the path from.
